# Introduction

`fec16` is a data package for use in the programming language R. It contains cleaned relational data from the 2015-2016 United States federal election cycle, hosted by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). 

The data includes authoritative information about candidates, committees, contributions, expenditures, and election results. Most datasets are included in full, while a small sample of the others is available with the option of retrieving the entire datasets through built-in functions. 

This package is useful as there exists a demand for such data in teaching. `fec16` is a one-stop-shop for interesting and clean data suitable for introductory statistics and data science students. 

# Objectives

1. Easy access to the data
2. Relational data suitable for teaching and learning
3. Data is pre-cleaned and wrangled 

# Why `fec16`?

There is always demand for quality data that is both open source and easy to access in the teaching of introductory statistics and data science. Therefore we created `fec16` that provides real data in a genre not seen often. Election data is diverse: it contains important financial and geopolitical information among other sub-categories. This genre is especially relevant as we near the 2020 U.S presidential elections in early November.

# Datasets Included

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
datasets <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSinV4oy98YdPhZqbT0OO84I6kaADgiYrGAvk4jFuo3x-Dg6Qr7s-BcmeE3l1rjD-00coMg27lUqO27/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv")
datasets %>%
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "c", "l"), "html")
```

For the datasets that are included as samples, the package includes functions called `read_all_*()`, where \* is the name of the dataset, that reads in the full dataset.
